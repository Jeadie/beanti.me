Tanda Hackathon Project 2018: Bringing employees together through coffee

## About
In this 24-hour hackathon, our team built a project around the theme of "Employee Experience". My team included @jdcaperon and @lighthou. The basic site provides real-time notifications to everyone on the site for when someone wants to go get coffee. 

### Process
1. Users can select their keeness for coffee on the slider. 
2. When a user presses the button, wanting coffee now everyone who is keen enough on the slider will be notified that its coffee time. 
3. If a user just got coffee, or doesn't want to receive notification simply put the slider to the left.
